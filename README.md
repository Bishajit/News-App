# News-app

For my custom app, I created an app that can get the headlines from an api and save it in a database.

The API I used is the news API https://newsapi.org/ 

This API allowed me to grab the headline. As a template, I followed this video on how to create an app.

This video also helped me understand the news API better

I went through a lot of issues with connecting my database to my application.py because I was trying to do it on my own but it was going well. This is where stack overflow helped me

This app allows you to track all the headlines you have read about because it store it in a database.
